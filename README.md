Here's my take on the Heroku app for a stock ticker.

The web app takes input for start date and ticker symbol for specific company.

The output is a plot showing the opening price, closing price, adjusted closing price, lowest and highest daily prices over time.

Instead of using a form input for selecting subplots I'm using interactive legends.
